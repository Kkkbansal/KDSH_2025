Worked on a  innovative automated framework that addresses
 two critical challenges in academic publishing: assessing paper publishabil
ity and recommending appropriate conferences. Using a combination of ad
vanced natural language processing techniques, including SciBERT, LDA
 topic modeling, and neural networks, The framework processes research pa
pers through a multi-stage pipeline, leveraging both semantic understanding
 and contextual relevance to provide justified recommendations. Our solution
 significantly reduces the manual effort required in the paper submission pro
cess while maintaining high accuracy and providing transparent justifications
 for its decisions.
